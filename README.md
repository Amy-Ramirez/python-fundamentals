# Python Practice: Hostname Dataset Generation and Analysis

This project was developed as part of the *Python Fundamentals* and *Advanced Python* modules in the Big Data & Data Science Master's program.
The goal of this practice is to create a synthetic dataset by generating random server hostnames using Python. The dataset is then used to build a Pandas DataFrame and visualize basic insights using Matplotlib.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib
